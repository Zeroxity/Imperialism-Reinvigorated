} # Beirut was controlled by local Druze emirs throughout the Ottoman period

#Fakhr-al-Din II, fortified it early in the 17th century, but the Ottomans reclaimed it in 1763.
#With the help of Damascus, Beirut successfully broke Acre's monopoly on Syrian maritime trade 
#and for a few years supplanted it as the main trading centre in the region.
#During the succeeding epoch of rebellion against Ottoman hegemony in Acre under Jezzar Pasha and Abdullah Pasha, Beirut declined
#to a small town with a population of about 10,000 and was an object of contention between the Ottomans, the local Druze, and the Mamluks.
